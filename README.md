# 👋 Hi, I'm Keith Sheridan

I'm a data analyst and current high school math educator with an M.S. in Applied Statistics from Villanova University. I specialize in transforming real-world data into actionable insights using R, Python, and statistical modeling. After over a decade of teaching, I’m pivoting into data analytics and data science; driven by a passion for clear communication, predictive modeling, and evidence-based decision making.

## 💡 Key Skills

- 📊 R (tidyverse, ggplot2, MASS, caret), Python, SAS
- 🧠 Regression, classification, machine learning, Bayesian modeling
- 🛠 SQL (basic), Excel, data wrangling, visualization
- ✍️ Strong communicator and collaborative problem solver
